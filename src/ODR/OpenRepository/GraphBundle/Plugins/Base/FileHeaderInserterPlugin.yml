    description: This plugin attempts to insert a header to any file that gets uploaded to the attached field, based on the values of other related datafields.  This is an advanced plugin that only works on a proper relational database setup...certain usage requirements force the plugin to provide every possible configuration, even though most of the available configurations will be completely worthless.  IMPORTANT - detaching this plugin does not delete the inserted headers, and changing the Comment Prefix after headers are inserted will result in duplicate headers.
