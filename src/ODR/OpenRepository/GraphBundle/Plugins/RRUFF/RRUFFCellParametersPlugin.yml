    description: This plugin provides a framework for entering crystallographic symmetry data.  In Edit mode, it restricts the available Crystal System, Point Group, Space Group, and Lattice data to ensure none of them conflict with each other.  In Display mode, it also tweaks the Point/Space groups so they're displayed nicer, and calculates volume when a value hasn't been entered by a user.

    ##### IMPORTANT #####
    # The "name" values defined for each of the required fields are critical  e.g.  name: Mineral ID
    # The php and twig files for this plugin use them to match renderplugin fields to actual datafields
    # ANY CHANGES TO THESE NAME VALUES MUST BE MADE IN THOSE FILES AS WELL

        # So for crystal system, point group, and space group...these values need to be restricted
        # Space group is technically the least restrictive, but the plugin needs to be hardcoded
        #  to suggest specific values, so...blame the people doing the refinements if one of them
        #  isn't listed

        # There's a grand total of 6 "official" crystal systems...
        # (technically 8, if you count "amorphous" and "unknown")
        # (additionally, euros tended to use "hexagonal" for point groups starting with 6, and tended
        #   to use "rhombohedral" or "trigonal" for those starting with 3...but RRUFF just uses the
        #   "hexagonal" crystal system for all of them)
