    # The "name" values defined for each of the required fields are critical  e.g.  name: Mineral ID
    # The php and twig files for this plugin use them to match renderplugin fields to actual datafields

        # (technically 8, if you could "amorphous" and "unknown")
        # (additionally, euros tended to use "hexagonal" for point groups starting with 6, and tended
        #   to use "rhombohedral" or "trigonal" for those starting with 3...but RRUFF just uses the
        #   "hexagonal" crystal system for all of them)
