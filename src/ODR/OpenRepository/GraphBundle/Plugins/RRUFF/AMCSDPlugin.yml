    description: This plugin attempts to mimic the original behavior of the American Mineralogy Crystal Structure Database (AMCSD).  Most of the required fields will be automatically filled out from an uploaded AMC File.
    registered_events:
        DatarecordCreatedEvent: onDatarecordCreate
        FileDeletedEvent: onFileDeleted
        FilePreEncryptEvent: onFilePreEncrypt

    ##### IMPORTANT #####
    # The "name" values defined for each of the required fields are critical  e.g.  name: fileno
    # AMCSDPlugin.php and twig files for this plugin use them to match renderplugin fields to actual datafields
    # ANY CHANGES TO THESE NAME VALUES MUST BE MADE IN THOSE TWO FILES AS WELL
    #####################

    # NOTE: the lack of the "is_derived" property for the required fields is intentional...the render
    #  plugin overrides the "AMC File" rendering to force a reload of the entire edit page when that
    #  datafield triggers the FileDeleted and FilePreEncrypt events...this page reload accomplishes
    #  the same thing
