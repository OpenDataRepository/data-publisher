    description: This plugin attempts to mimic the original behavior of the American Mineralogy Crystal Structure Database (AMCSD).  Most of the required fields will be automatically filled out from an uploaded AMC File.
    registered_events:
        DatarecordCreatedEvent: onDatarecordCreate
        FileDeletedEvent: onFileDeleted
        FilePreEncryptEvent: onFilePreEncrypt
#        PostMassEditEvent: onPostMassEdit    # TODO - ...don't think i want this firing unless explicitly requested

    ##### IMPORTANT #####
    # The "name" values defined for each of the required fields are critical  e.g.  name: fileno
    # AMCSDPlugin.php and twig files for this plugin use them to match renderplugin fields to actual datafields
    # ANY CHANGES TO THESE NAME VALUES MUST BE MADE IN THOSE TWO FILES AS WELL
    #####################

    # NOTE: the "is_derived" property for the required fields isn't technically needed...that
    #  property is primarily for "surgical reloading" of a derived field after a source field is
    #  modified...but the AMCSD plugin instead overrides the "AMC File" rendering to force a reload
    #  of the entire edit page when that datafield triggers the FileDeleted and FilePreEncrypt events.
    # NOTE: this also means that AMCSDPlugin.php does NOT need to implement DatafieldReloadOverrideInterface
